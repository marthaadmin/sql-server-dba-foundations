# SQL Server System Databases

## Objective
Understand SQL Server system databases, what they do, and how DBAs interact with them safely.

## System Databases Explained (Security Director Example)

Think of SQL Server as a secured building.

- **master** → Head security office (controls the whole building)
- **model** → Blueprint for new rooms
- **msdb** → Control room (jobs, alerts, backups)
- **tempdb** → Temporary work area
- **ResourceDB** → Locked internal engine room

## Databases and Use Cases

### master
- Stores instance configuration and logins
- SQL Server cannot start without it
- Must be backed up regularly

### model
- Template for new databases
- Controls default settings for new DBs

### msdb
- Stores SQL Agent jobs
- Backup and restore history
- Alerts and maintenance plans

### tempdb
- Temporary objects and operations
- Recreated on every SQL Server restart
- Major performance impact

### ResourceDB
- Hidden and read-only
- Stores system objects
- Updated during patching

## DBA Rule
❌ Never store application data in system databases  
✔ Understand them, protect them, and monitor them
