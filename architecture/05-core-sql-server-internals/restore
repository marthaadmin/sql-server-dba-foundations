# SQL Server Restore Operations

## Objective
Safely recover databases after failure or data loss.

## Restore States

- WITH RECOVERY → Database online
- WITH NORECOVERY → Database waiting for more restores
- WITH STANDBY → Read-only access

## Typical Restore Sequence (Full Recovery)

1. Restore full backup (NORECOVERY)
2. Restore differential (optional)
3. Restore log backups in order
4. Restore tail-log
5. WITH RECOVERY

## Common DBA Mistakes
❌ Restoring log backups out of order  
❌ Forgetting NORECOVERY  
❌ Skipping tail-log backup  
❌ Restoring directly over production

## DBA Truth
Backups save data.  
Restores save careers.
