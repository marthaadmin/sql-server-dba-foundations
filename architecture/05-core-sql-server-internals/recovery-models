# SQL Server Recovery Models

## Objective
Understand how recovery models control data protection and restore options.

## Recovery Models

### Full Recovery
- All transactions logged
- Supports point-in-time restore
- Requires log backups
- Used in production

### Bulk-Logged Recovery
- Minimally logs bulk operations
- Used during large data loads
- Limited point-in-time recovery

### Simple Recovery
- Log truncates automatically
- No log backups
- Limited restore options
- Used in dev/test

## Common DBA Mistake
Running Full recovery without log backups leads to log file growth and outages.

## DBA Rule
Recovery model must match business recovery requirements.
