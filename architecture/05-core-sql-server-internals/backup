# SQL Server Backup Concepts

## Objective
Understand backup types and how they protect data.

## Backup Types

### Full Backup
- Foundation of all restores
- Required for recovery

### Differential Backup
- Changes since last full backup
- Faster restore process

### Transaction Log Backup
- Captures transactions
- Enables point-in-time restore

### Copy-Only Backup
- Does not break backup chain
- Used for ad-hoc operations

### Tail-Log Backup
- Last chance to capture data
- Taken before restore after failure

## DBA Rule
A backup is useless until it has been restored successfully.
