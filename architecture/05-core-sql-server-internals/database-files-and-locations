# SQL Server Database Files and Locations

## Objective
Understand how SQL Server databases are stored physically on disk.

## File Types Explained

### .mdf (Primary Data File)
- Core database data
- Metadata, tables, indexes
- One per database (required)

### .ndf (Secondary Data Files)
- Optional
- Used for large databases
- Improves performance and manageability

### .ldf (Transaction Log File)
- Records all database transactions
- Critical for recovery
- Required for point-in-time restores

## Why .ldf Is Critical
The transaction log is like CCTV footage.
Without it, SQL Server cannot replay or recover transactions.

## Best Practices
- Separate data and log files
- Never delete .mdf or .ldf manually
- Avoid frequent shrinking

## DBA Mindset
Logical databases live in SSMS.  
Physical databases live on disk.
