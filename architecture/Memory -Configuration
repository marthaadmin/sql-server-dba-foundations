# SQL Server Memory Configuration (DBA Best Practice)

## Objective
Configure SQL Server memory to balance performance and system stability.

---

## Why Memory Configuration Matters
By default, SQL Server can consume all available system memory.
If not controlled, this can starve the operating system and cause instability.

As a DBA, it is best practice to configure both:
- Maximum server memory
- Minimum server memory

---

## Memory Configuration Steps (SSMS)

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
2. Connect to the SQL Server instance
3. Right-click the server name → Properties
4. Select **Memory**
5. Configure:
   - Max Server Memory = 80% of total system memory
   - Min Server Memory = ~30% of total system memory
6. Click OK

## Lab Example

Server Memory: 8 GB (8188 MB)

- Max Server Memory: 6550MB
- Min Server Memory: 2456MB

---

## Misconfiguration Scenarios

### No Max Memory Set
- SQL Server consumes all memory
- OS becomes unstable
- RDP and SSMS become slow

### Max Memory Too Low
- Poor query performance
- High CPU usage
- Constant cache eviction

### No Min Memory Set
- Memory grows and shrinks aggressively
- Unstable performance

---

## DBA Takeaway
Proper memory configuration is a foundational DBA responsibility.
Memory issues often appear as query or application problems but originate at the server level.
