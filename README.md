# SQL Server DBA Foundations (Class 1–4)

## Project Overview
This project documents my hands-on DBA foundation labs using Google Cloud Platform.
The goal was to build a realistic SQL Server environment similar to what is used in real enterprise environments.

## Lab Architecture
The lab environment consists of three Windows servers hosted on Google Cloud Compute Engine:

- **SQLAD** – Active Directory Domain Controller  
- **SQL01** – SQL Server (Domain-joined)  
- **SQL02** – SQL Server (Domain-joined)

All servers are deployed in the same network and zone, with static internal and external IP addresses.
